<h1>SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT NOTES</h1>

<h2>Python Virtual Environment</h2>
<p><b>What is a virtual environment?</b></p>
<p>It is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated Python virtual environments for them.</p>

<p><b>Why do we use virtual environments?</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Solve dependency issues: Different versions of a package for different projects.</li>
  <li>Projects self-contained and reproducible.</li>
  <li>Install packages on a machine without having admin privileges.</li>
  <li>The global site-packages/ directory (Python packages are installed here) remains clean because  you are not installing packages system-wide.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Installing pyenv</b></p>
<p>Pyenv is a popular open-source tool used for managing multiple Python installations on a single system.  It allows you to easily switch between different versions of Python, create virtual environments, and manage dependencies for Python projects. </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>Install the prerequisites:</b></p>
    <pre>
      sudo apt update; sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \
libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev curl \
libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev
    </pre>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Run pyenv installer:</p>
    <pre>
      curl https://pyenv.run | bash
    </pre>
    <p>The installer asks to insert a few lines into ~/.bashrc (use your favorite text editor: vim):</p>

    <pre>
      export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
      eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
      eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
    </pre>
    <p>Those lines will load the pyenv executable into your shell environment.</p>
  </li>
  
</ul>
<p>List the available Python versions:</p>
<pre>pyenv install –list</pre>

<p>When new Python versions are available you can refresh the list of the versions with this command: </p>
<pre>pyenv update</pre>
<p>Usually, the lastest stable version should be installed (3.11.5 when I wrote this tutorial)</p>
<pre>pyenv install 3.11.5</pre>

<p>Check Python installed versions with pyenv:</p>
<pre>pyenv versions</pre>

<p>Type <pre>pyenv versions </pre> and you will notice that Python 3.11.5 is activated, and this version is in used because there is a file .python-version with the version described inside the file.</p>

<p>Let’s create a folder for our first project. Go inside the folder and type:</p>
<pre>pyenv local 3.11.5</pre>
<p>That creates a file .python-version in the current folder.</p>

<h2>Python Virtual Environment </h2>
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.htm">Documentation</a>
<p>Let's run the command:</p>
<pre>python -m venv env_3.11.5</pre>

<p>This folder contains some python executable and some libraries and will be able to host independently the python package we are going to install without interfering with the python installed at the system level.</p>

<p>Delete the file .python-version, just to remove any ambiguities. And let's load the python virtual env:</p>
<pre>source env_3.11.5/bin/activate</pre>

<p>Check the Python version:</p>
<pre>which python</pre>
<p>You will see that the python executable used is coming from the virtual env folder.</p>

<p>If you want to deactivate the python virtual env, just run:</p>
<pre>deactivate</pre>


<h2>Password Management</h2>

<p>It is important to securely store, generate and manage passwords.</p>
<p>There are many online password management applications that provide convenience. However, there could be some disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dependency on the Internet: These applications require Internet access. If, for some reason, your Internet is down, you cannot access your passwords.</li>
  <li>Security Risks: Your passwords can be accessed by a third-party service.</li>
  <li>Data Breaches: Unauthorized parties access to the sensitive data in the servers.</li>
  <li>Cost: There are some applications free, but those that offer robust security could be expensive.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of using an online password management application, we can use a tool that allows us to store an encrypted file with the password we need in a desired location.</p>

<p><b>KeePassXC</b> is a secure and open-sources password manager that can help to store passwords.</p>

<h3>KeePassXC</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Download <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a></li>
  <li>Go to the folder where KeePassXC was downloaded, right-click on the icon, click on Permission, and select the checkbox "Allow executing file as program". Close the properties window. </li>
  <li>Now, you can execute KeePassXC. Double-click on the icon.</li>
  <li>You can create a new database for your passwords, adjust the database encryption, add your passwords, and save the database (file) with your passwords.</li>
</ul>
<p>I suggest that you store the KeePassXC database in Google Drive and have your Google Drive mounted on your computer as a driver.</p>

<h3>Mount Google Drive</h3>
<p><b>Linux:</b></p>
<p>On Linux Mint (or a Debian derivative), you can go to your System Settings -> Online Accounts -> Google, and enter your credentials. Now, you should have Google Drive mounted as a drive in your computer. When selecting the Google product to mount, you must choose only 'files', unselect the other options.</p>
</p>
<p><b>Windows and MacOS: Download Google Driver Client <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/download/">here</a></b></p>

<p>You will see Google Drive mounted on your computer as another drive.</p>

<p>Path Google Drive mounted: /run/user/your_user_session_id/gvfs/your_google_drive/</p>

<p>Check your session id: loginctl list-sessions</p>


<p>Possible issue when adding Google credentials: Password does not match the original (keyring)</p>
<p><b>Solution:</b></p>
<p>Go to Passwords and Keys in your computer. Right click on Login -> Delete</p>

  
<h2>Pre-work</h2>

<p>SoftDev pre-work aims to learn/review the basics of Python, the backend programming language that will be used in this course. While some students have already worked with Python, it is a new language for others. The programming skills learned using Java last year will help to pick Python quickly because Python is a dynamic language, and the syntax is easier than Java.</p>
