<h2>Password Management</h2>

<p>It is important to securely store, generate and manage passwords.</p>
<p>There are many online password management application that provide convenience. However, there could be some disadvatages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dependency on Internet: These applications require Internet access. If for some reason you Internet is down, you cannot access your passwords.</li>
  <li>Security Risks: Your passwords can be accessed by a third-party service.</li>
  <li>Data Breaches: Unauthorized parties access to the sensitive data in the servers.(</li>
  <li>Cost: There are some applications free, but those that offer robust security could be expensive.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of using an online password management application, we can use a tool that allows to store an encrypted file with the password we need in a desired location.</p>

<p><b>KeePassXC</b> is a secure and open-sources password manager that can help to store passwords.</p>

<h3>KeePassXC</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Download <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a></li>
  <li>Go to the folder where KeePassXC was downloaded, right-click on the icon, click on Permission, select the checkbox "Allow executing file as program". Close the properties window. </li>
  <li>Now, you can excecute KeePassXC. Double click on the icon.</li>
  <li>You can create a new database for your passwords, adjust the database encryptation, add your passwords, and save database (file) with your passwords.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pre-work</h2>

<p>SoftDev pre-work aims to learn/review the basics of Python, the backend programming language that will be used in this course. While some students have already worked with Python, it is a new language for others. The programming skills learned using Java last year will help to pick Python quickly because Python is a dynamic language, and the syntax is easier than Java.</p>

<p>Please go to the Homework webpage to find the directions to complete your pre-work. </p>
