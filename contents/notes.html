<h1>WELCOME TO SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT!!!</h1>

<h2>Pre-work</h2>

<p>SoftDev pre-work aims to learn/review the basics of Python, the backend programming language that will be used in this course. While some students have already worked with Python, it is a new language for others. The programming skills learned using Java last year will help to pick Python quickly because Python is a dynamic language, and the syntax is easier than Java.</p>
